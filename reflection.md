Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

I decided to overload the constructors, and I chose to have one with just the name, and one with just the name and the address, because I felt like those two are the information that people would easily have about a building .
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked for me was to go to TA hours to get clear on the expectations of the assignment. I also understood overriding and overloading relatively well so it was not too hard for me to do this assignment.
